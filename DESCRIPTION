Description: Topological Data Analysis using Mapper (discrete Morse theory).
    Generate a 1-dimensional simplicial complex from a filter 
    function defined on the data:  1. Define a filter function (lens) on the 
    data.  2. Perform clustering within within each level set and generate 
    one node (vertex) for each cluster.  3. For each pair of clusters in 
    adjacent level sets with a nonempty intersection, generate one edge 
    between vertices.  The function mapper1D uses a filter function with
    codomain R, while the the function mapper2D uses a filter function with
    codomain R^2.
